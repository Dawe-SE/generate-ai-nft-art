# generate-ai-nft-art
A script that uses an external website, mimicking a real user with Selenium to generate thousands of images. Then to replace the frame around the "trading card" styled image there is an additional script for that.
This is deprecated as the website has changed, but with a few tweaks it will work again. Uses Selenium.
